      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h3>
        My name is Bek Omonkulov. I am a full-stack/software developer based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. My development journey started back in 2014 when I used Roblox studio to make my first game - turns out you can learn a lot from a simple block game! Fast forward to today, I use my coding skills to overcome all types of problems. Whether the challenge is tackling huge problems like creating an artificial intelligence-based medical image viewer, or a simple geography game to hone your geography skills, I always rely on my passion for programming to help me get past it.
